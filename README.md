# bank-system
NOTE: This project is not complete yet. \
Through the command line, it simulates an online banking system that allows multiple users to check account balances, deposit money, withdraw money, view transactions. Users will have a username and password and sign in with such.\
This project gives me practice with dynamic memory allocation (vector class) among other things in C++. I would like to acknowledge, however, that a linked list would be much more time-efficient for adding or removing users, or for each transaction (since each of those is stored in a vector array). \
Can be compiled with the given Makefile.
