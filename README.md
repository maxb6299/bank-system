# bank-system
Can be compiled and run with the given Makefile. 

Through the command line, this program simulates an online banking system where different users can: create/delete accounts, sign in/out, check account balances, deposit/withdraw money, view transaction history. Users will have a username and password and sign in with such. 

It utilizes dynamic memory allocation (vector class) to store the accounts as well as the transaciton history. I would like to acknowledge, however, that a linked list would be much more time-efficient for adding or removing users, or for storing each transaction. 

I made this project to gain experience with the vector class as well as reinforce general C++ skills.
